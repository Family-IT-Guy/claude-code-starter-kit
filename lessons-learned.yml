# Lessons Learned - Behavioral Improvement Tracker
#
# Definition: A lesson is a pattern that produces suboptimal outputs or errors
# that can be addressed to prevent errors or produce more optimal outcomes
# in the future.
#
# Captured by: session-end workflow (Step 1.5)
# Surfaced by: session-start workflow (Step 4)
#
# Scope includes: behavioral mistakes, workflow inefficiencies, tool misuse,
# communication failures, knowledge gaps, assumption failures - anything
# where a pattern led to a suboptimal result and a systemic change could
# prevent recurrence.
#
# Entry format:
#   - id:            Sequential integer
#     date:          Date captured (YYYY-MM-DD)
#     project:       Project where the pattern was observed
#     status:        pending | accepted | rejected | archived
#
#     pattern:       What happened - the observable behavior or sequence of
#                    events. Enough narrative context for a fresh session to
#                    fully understand the situation.
#
#     root_cause:    Why it happened - detailed analysis of the underlying
#                    cause. Not surface-level ("forgot the rule") but
#                    structural ("the rule has no enforcement mechanism").
#
#     impact:        What went wrong or was suboptimal - concrete consequences
#                    including wasted effort, broken output, user intervention.
#
#     example:       Specific incident from the session that illustrates the
#                    pattern. Include enough detail to serve as a reference.
#
#     proposed_fix:  What should change systemically - a durable change to
#                    CLAUDE.md rules, skills, workflows, or process that would
#                    prevent recurrence.
#
#     resolution:    (null when pending) Where the fix was codified when
#                    accepted, or rationale when rejected.
#
# Lifecycle:
#   pending   - Captured but not yet discussed with user
#   accepted  - User approved; fix has been codified (resolution says where)
#   rejected  - User decided against; resolution explains why
#   archived  - Previously accepted, kept for historical reference
#
# No artificial caps on number of entries or verbosity. Thoroughness of
# capture is more valuable than brevity - the next session needs full
# context to act on these.
#
# Cleanup policy: Accepted and rejected entries are removed once codified
# or decided. The fixes live in their target docs (CLAUDE.md, skills,
# workflows). Only pending entries remain in this file.
