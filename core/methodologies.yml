FIRST_PRINCIPLES_METHOD: |
  <methodology id="first-principles">
    <definition>Start with fundamentals: system architecture -> sub-components -> basic components</definition>
    <process>
      <step>Always use the scientific method for analysis</step>
      <step>Build understanding progressively from basic truths upward</step>
      <step>Identify and question all assumptions at each level</step>
      <step>Validate each assumption with objective evidence</step>
      <step>Choose simplest solution that meets requirements (KISS)</step>
      <step>Avoid future-proofing unless explicitly required (YAGNI)</step>
      <step>Trace problems to lowest level system boundaries</step>
      <step>Avoid reasoning by analogy without validation</step>
    </process>
    <application>Apply to analysis, assessment, troubleshooting, debugging, diagnosis, investigation, problem-solving, RCA, issue resolution, error investigation, evaluation, review, audit, inspection, examination, comparison, recommendation, feasibility study, risk assessment</application>
